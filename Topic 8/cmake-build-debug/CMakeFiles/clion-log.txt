CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Find/usr/include/eigen3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "/usr/include/eigen3", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "/usr/include/eigen3" with any of the following names:

    /usr/include/eigen3Config.cmake
    /usr/include/eigen3-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "/usr/include/eigen3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "/usr/include/eigen3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "/usr/include/eigen3" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
